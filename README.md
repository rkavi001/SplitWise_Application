# SplitWise_application

This project visualizes a financial settlement system using a graph where each node represents a person, and the edges between nodes represent financial transactions (cash flow). It dynamically generates random problems and provides an optimized solution to settle all debts with minimal transactions.

Features
1.Random Graph Generation: Generates a random group of people and their financial transactions.
2.Optimized Transaction Settlement: Calculates the net balance of each person and minimizes the number of transactions required to settle all debts.
3.Visualization: Utilizes vis.js to visually represent the problem and its solution in an intuitive graph format.
4.Interactive User Interface: Users can generate new problems or solve existing ones with the click of a button.

Technology Stack

1.Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2.Data Structure: Binary Heap for efficient settlement calculations
